	"description": "What RPG would be complete without enemies dropping neat items 1% of the time? Treat yourself to 68 brand new rare and uncommon items to spice up your Qud experience. Broaden your horizons by throwing spiders at your foes, turn your companions into water factories using mechanized leeches to become a water baron, light areas with battery powered flashlights or mildly hazardous chemical reactions! Cozy up to a space heater, become one with the shadows with an edgy cloak, torch your foes with wrist-mounted flamethrowers, or just beat them down with a jawbone. Want to amplify your psionic powers? Steal blood and turn it to water? Get worthwhile rewards for taking on salt krakens, chrome pyramids, and leering stalkers? Or do you just want to be a mama bird to a flock of glowcrows that seem to have imprinted on you?  Do all this and more with 1%: Loot Drops Expanded!\r\n\r\nIMMERSIVE ITEMS:\r\n1% adds no new creatures to the game, and uses all-vanilla assets to fit right in with the base game. No jarring, out of place textures or wacky, broken mechanics will be found on a single item in this pack. The goal is to expand the existing Qud experience, not to change it. Using other mods? Don't worry, every item has a unique ID to avoid compatibility conflicts. \r\n\r\nWORK FOR YOUR LOOT:\r\nStealing from vendors isn't going to cut it here. Most items in this pack aren't included in merchant tables, and often aren't in anyone's inventory at all. You can't just talk a salt kraken into giving up its valuable hide, you've gotta fight the beast yourself. Don't want to kill the same baddies over and over? No worries, enough creatures are given drops that you're bound to run into some items without even trying. \r\n\r\nTHROW THINGS:\r\nKnock the blades off saw-handers, steal ribs from trolls, or cut out the venom glands from girshworms to expand your item-chucking options in combat. Light the way forward by throwing an activated chemlamp or glowfish scales, or just wear a glowpad on your head.\r\n\r\nBECOME THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION:\r\nCut wine producing vines from jilted-lovers, convert bio-waste into water, or wear solar panels to fill up those empty energy cells. Not enough? Farm some spider eggs, start a nuclear power plant, or steal the psyches of esper assassins by luring them to you with a psionic beacon. 1% has plenty of options, allowing you to grind however you want, or not at all.\r\n\r\nGET MORE:\r\nMore than a dozen new items have been added in updates since the mod's initial release, and more are likely to follow. Suppress fires with emergency coolant pumps, summon dogs to be your allies, actually get a waydroid buddy from Golgotha, create green energy with sap powered cells, use plastic water bottles to carry small servings of liquids, become a master of unarmed combat, or steal the carapace from a great saltback to have that high-tier shield you've been waiting for. Want to steal a chrome pyramid's reactor? Now you can. 1% fills the gaps in items without breaking immersion or balance.\r\n\r\nITEM LIST:\r\nWant to know where to find something? Here's a list. Want it to be a surprise? Read no further. Want the raw item IDs to wish them in for a test run? Pop open the mod's ObjectBlueprints file because I only have so many characters here.\r\n\r\nBreeder Cell/Fusion Cell: Chrome Pyramid, Leering Stalker\r\nChem Lamp: Glow Wights, Caravan Guards, Pilgrims\r\nSilk Slippers: All Spiders\r\nMuscle Doper: Caravan Guards, Snapjaw Brutes\r\nWitchwood Club: Witchwood trees, Naphtaali\r\nBox of Holy Treats: Cats\r\nBox of Holy Catnip: Dogs\r\nMagma Aegis: Great Magma Crab\r\nConvalessant Gland: Blue Jel\r\nPower Saw: Sawhanders\r\nCoolerator (emergency coolant pump): Rimewyk\r\nBEAUTYGRAM: Templars\r\nKnuckledusters: Snapjaw Brutes\r\nSports Cap: Farmers, Snapjaw Hunters\r\nPlastifer Flask (water bottle): Ichor Merchants\r\nBoonie Cap: Snapjaw Hunters and Mysterious Gunslingers\r\nFu Wraps: Baboons\r\nAnticarbon Emitter Cannon: Decarbonizer\r\nFlora Cell: Asphodelytes\r\nSalt Pavise: Great Saltback\r\nWaydroid Orb: Barathrumites and at certain places in Golgotha\r\nPlantpack: Naphtaali\r\nSpace Heater: Mechanimists\r\nReclamation Pellet: Issachari \r\nShadow Cloak: Vanta Plants\r\nKatar: Issachari \r\nTargeting Interface: Mysterious Gunslingers\r\nCupid's Arrow:  Apple Farmer's Daughter\r\nNaphtaali Mask: Naphtaali\r\nTorcher Gauntlet: Acronauts \r\nHyrkhound Jawbone: Hyrkhounds\r\nThinking Cap: Barathrumites, Swine\r\nSap Proboscis: All Saps\r\nCircular Sawblade: Sawhander\r\nSnapjaw Jawbone: Snapjaw Warlords and Feeders\r\nRam's Horn: All Goats & Goatfolk\r\nSparking Mandibles: Electrofuge & Spark Tick\r\nLiving Krakenhide: Salt Kraken\r\nKraken Pearl: Salt Kraken\r\nSymbiotic Vinovine: Jilted Lover\r\nSanguine Catalyzer: Issachari\r\nMadpole Maw: Madpole\r\nPearlfrog Tongue: Pearlfrog\r\nBone Dart: Snapjaws, Issachari\r\nTroll Rib: Trolls\r\nThistlecrown: Thirst Thistle\r\nGlow Wreath: Glowpads\r\nGlowfish Scales: Glowfish\r\nElder Cyclopean Skull: Cyclopean Gibbon\r\nVorpal Sword: Arch Dervish of the Sightless Way\r\nPsionic Amplifier/Focus, Psionic Beacon, Seeker's Mask: All Sightless Way\r\nFemur and Giant Skull: Cannibals\r\nRage Robe: Cannibals\r\nMechastinger: Scorpiock\r\nFabulous Cape: Dromad\r\nSolar Pack: Barathrumites, Issachari\r\nGlowcrow Egg: Glowcrow\r\nCave Spider Egg: Cave Spider\r\nVenom Sac: Brown Sludge, Girshworm, Scorpiock, Slog of the Cloaca\r\nChromatic Illustrator: Scrapbot, Arconauts, Trash Monks\r\nChargelamp (flashlight): Templar\r\nBiomanager: Boosterbot\r\nSlime Gland: Giant Amoeba\r\nArc Band: Arconauts, Trash Monk\r\nMercenary Wasp: Glowpad, Solid Trees\n\n\nThis mod has had work done to enable it to function with Release 1.0.
